1
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:11,166
Do you know when disasters first became a subject of scientific research?

2
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:19,466
A major turning point was the Great Lisbon Earthquake that occurred on November 1, 1755

3
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:27,933
About 270 years ago in Europe, earthquakes were believed to be the wrath of God

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,533
The Great Lisbon Earthquake became a major catalyst for changing that belief

5
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:39,733
It not only made earthquakes a subject of scientific study

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,500
but also fundamentally transformed the way scientific research itself was conducted

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,400
Today, let's trace how disasters once thought to be divine wrath

8
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:54,900
became subjects of scientific inquiry

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,966
and explore this historical journey

10
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:05,900
First, let's look at the scale of the Great Lisbon Earthquake

11
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:13,733
It occurred on November 1, 1755, around 9:40 AM

12
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:20,000
The epicenter was about 220 km off Cape St. Vincent in the Atlantic Ocean

13
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,100
The estimated magnitude was between 8.5 and 9

14
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:31,566
Similar to or even larger than the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake

15
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:37,966
This earthquake destroyed approximately 85% of the buildings in Lisbon

16
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:42,600
and the death toll is estimated to have reached 30,000 to 40,000 people

17
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:47,100
What was particularly terrifying was the triple disaster

18
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:52,066
First, building collapses from three major tremors

19
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:57,433
Then, a massive tsunami that struck after the sea first receded

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,366
And fires that broke out throughout the city from overturned cooking equipment

21
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:09,100
Contemporary copper engravings show the devastating scale of the destruction

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,466
Moreover, the tsunami reached as far as the Azores and the West Indies

23
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:20,000
and tremors were observed throughout Europe

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,600
This was a widespread disaster that caused massive damage across all of Europe and the Atlantic

25
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:33,400
So why did this earthquake become such a special turning point in the history of science?

26
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:39,800
It is deeply related to the timing and location of this earthquake

27
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:46,866
November 1st was All Saints' Day, an important Catholic holiday

28
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,866
Devout citizens were attending Mass in churches

29
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:55,000
when the earthquake struck at that very moment

30
00:02:56,233 --> 00:03:00,700
While churches collapsed and many believers perished

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,033
brothels and similar establishments remained unscathed, and people began to question

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,733
"Why did God destroy a city of good citizens?"

33
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:16,933
To draw a Japanese analogy, it would be like shrines and temples being destroyed

34
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:21,333
while the flashy entertainment district buildings remained intact

35
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,100
Here, two interpretations came into conflict

36
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:29,233
One was the traditional divine punishment theory

37
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,233
The interpretation that it was God's wrath against the citizens' sins

38
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,333
The other was a new approach: exploring it scientifically as a natural phenomenon

39
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:52,166
This conflict became the starting point for historically viewing earthquakes as natural disasters from a scientific perspective

40
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,466
Actually, even before the Great Lisbon Earthquake

41
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:02,033
a culture of scientific observation was already developing in Europe

42
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:07,966
In 1660, the Royal Society of London was established

43
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,533
Its motto was "Nullius in verba"

44
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,100
meaning "Take nobody's word for it"

45
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,266
In other words, not "because the Bible says so"

46
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,200
or "because the Church says so"

47
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:27,166
but rather observe directly, gather data, and think for yourself

48
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,200
In 1665, the scientific journal Philosophical Transactions was launched

49
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,100
and earthquake reports began to accumulate

50
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:44,700
In the approximately 90 years before the Great Lisbon Earthquake, about 70 observational records were collected

51
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,700
Particularly important was the London earthquake of 1750

52
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,433
Many reports were made about this earthquake

53
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:58,833
and an interesting observation was made here

54
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,700
It was the concept of "earthquake trajectory"

55
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,566
The arrival time and intensity of shaking varied by location

56
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,566
In other words, the recognition emerged that "earthquakes are moving phenomena"

57
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:22,200
This was the starting point for our modern understanding of seismic wave propagation from the epicenter

58
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,466
So by the time the Great Lisbon Earthquake occurred

59
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:31,000
there was already nearly a century of accumulated observational records

60
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:37,133
and the seeds of a scientific methodology for interpreting earthquakes scientifically had sprouted

61
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:43,033
So far, we've looked at the preparatory period before the Great Lisbon Earthquake

62
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:49,600
The accumulation of observational records, the empirical rule that earthquakes are moving phenomena

63
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,266
These formed the foundation that made scientific investigation after the disaster possible

64
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,033
Now, let's look at how people actually reacted

65
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:03,500
when the great earthquake occurred

66
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:07,566
Now, when the Great Lisbon Earthquake struck

67
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,833
two people showed contrasting reactions

68
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,466
One was the Jesuit missionary Gabriel Malagrida

69
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:23,433
He preached that "This is divine punishment for the sins of the citizens"

70
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:30,033
The other was the Portuguese Prime Minister, the Marquis of Pombal, Carvalho

71
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:33,566
He took an entirely different approach

72
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,533
Carvalho conducted a scientific questionnaire survey

73
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,900
The questions were something like this:

74
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,733
"What time did the earthquake start and how long did it last?"

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,333
"Did the sea recede or rise?"

76
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,833
"How high was it?"

77
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:57,100
"Was there a directional pattern to building collapses?"

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,766
In other words, instead of asking "Why did God cause such a disaster?"

79
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,133
he asked "How did the earthquake occur?"

80
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:11,233
and "What kind of damage resulted from the earthquake?"

81
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,866
This difference illustrates the essence of scientific inquiry

82
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:23,833
While theological interpretation asks "Why did God cause this?"

83
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:29,666
the scientific approach seeks to clarify how it happened

84
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:39,233
Furthermore, when rebuilding Lisbon, Carvalho adopted the earthquake-resistant Gaiola structure

85
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:46,300
and reportedly had soldiers march to make buildings vibrate as an empirical test

86
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:55,166
This is considered one of the earliest examples of applying experimental scientific methods to disaster preparedness

87
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,766
News of the Great Lisbon Earthquake spread throughout Europe, and many intellectuals responded

88
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,433
One of them was the famous philosopher Immanuel Kant

89
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:15,700
In 1756, Kant published three papers in quick succession

90
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:18,933
Kant's argument was clear

91
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:24,333
"Earthquakes are purely physical and chemical phenomena"

92
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,400
He proposed a hypothesis that earthquakes were caused by underground combustion of sulfur and iron

93
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,566
From the perspective of modern seismology, this hypothesis has been disproven

94
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:46,033
However, what was important was the attempt to understand earthquake mechanisms as scientific phenomena

95
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:48,500
Kant said:

96
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,300
"Earthquakes are not divine punishment"

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,300
"They are merely natural phenomena"

98
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,900
"They are necessary phenomena following natural laws and have no moral meaning"

99
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:04,633
This was a revolutionary claim for its time

100
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,733
completely rejecting theological interpretation

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,266
Then a person who made important contributions to the development of seismology appeared

102
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,400
The English physicist John Michell

103
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:27,333
In 1759, Michell submitted a paper on earthquakes to the Royal Society

104
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,566
and was elected a Fellow in 1760

105
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:35,533
This paper is recognized as a pioneering work in seismology

106
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,300
and is still highly regarded today

107
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:41,966
Michell's contributions were groundbreaking

108
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,266
He theorized that earthquakes propagate as waves

109
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:53,166
This was one of the earliest theories to conceptualize earthquakes as waves

110
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,933
He also proposed a geometric approach to estimate where earthquakes occurred

111
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,333
what we now call determining the epicenter

112
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,966
Furthermore, he estimated the propagation speed of earthquakes at about 530 m/s

113
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:18,300
We now know that seismic waves (P-waves) travel at 5-8 km/s

114
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,700
but this was a revolutionary attempt for its time

115
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:28,366
Michell also pointed out that tsunamis are caused by submarine earthquakes

116
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:33,033
and that geological faulting is related to earthquakes

117
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,566
These insights were extremely important contributions to understanding earthquakes scientifically

118
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:47,933
What enabled Michell to make these scientific observations?

119
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,000
It was the power of data

120
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,700
The empirical rule from the 1750 London earthquake that earthquakes are moving phenomena

121
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,066
Carvalho's systematic questionnaire survey

122
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Based on this data, Michell was able to accurately estimate

123
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,833
the epicenter of the Great Lisbon Earthquake as being in the Atlantic Ocean

124
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,900
Here we see the beginning of data-based scientific earthquake research

125
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,733
Now, let's move to the mid-19th century

126
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:31,433
Here we meet Robert Mallet, known as "the father of seismology"

127
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,433
Mallet studied earthquakes through an experimental approach

128
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,666
In 1849, Mallet buried explosives underground and conducted blast experiments

129
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,500
He measured the speed of seismic waves at a location about 800 meters away

130
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,700
About 251 m/s in wet sand

131
00:11:56,366 --> 00:12:00,366
About 427 m/s in granite

132
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,833
In other words, he demonstrated that propagation speed varies depending on the medium

133
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,100
This was a very important discovery for understanding the properties of seismic waves

134
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,133
And in 1858, Mallet created a world seismic distribution map

135
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:29,600
He catalogued about 6,800 historical earthquakes and showed that earthquakes occur predominantly in specific regions

136
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:37,766
Remarkably, this distribution closely matches the plate boundaries we know today

137
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:44,133
The scientific inquiry that began with the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake

138
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,666
through the contributions of scientists like Kant, Michell, and Mallet

139
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:55,633
can be said to have established seismology as an academic discipline over about 100 years

140
00:12:56,433 --> 00:13:02,166
And this scientific knowledge is now being used for modern disaster prevention and mitigation

141
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,633
Earthquake early warning systems, earthquake-resistant construction, tsunami warning systems

142
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,733
All of these can be said to be extensions of the scientific inquiry

143
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:18,166
that began in Lisbon over 250 years ago

144
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:27,833
On November 1, 1755, the great earthquake that struck Lisbon

145
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:34,000
became a major catalyst for making disasters subjects of natural science research

146
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,366
And today, that scientific knowledge

147
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:43,733
is being applied to disaster prevention and mitigation technologies that protect our lives

148
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:51,100
I hope you've gained a sense of how history connects to our lives today

149
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,166
Until next time, take care!
