1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:03,100
GPS on smartphones is really convenient, isn't it?

2
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:06,966
I'm embarrassed to admit I have a terrible sense of direction

3
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:14,100
Without GPS and smartphone map apps
I can barely get to my destination

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,700
But GPS relies on signals from space

5
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:25,700
It doesn't work when you're in a tunnel
or on a ferry out at sea

6
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,966
And it can be disabled by malicious jamming signals

7
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:37,066
But is there a way to measure position with high precision without GPS?

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,500
Actually, a technology called quantum navigation
using ultra-cold atoms is rapidly developing

9
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:53,466
In 2025, there was news that Boeing and
the British Navy succeeded in demonstration tests

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,833
Today, I'll explain why cooling atoms
allows us to determine position

11
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:00,400
Let's look at how it works

12
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:10,733
First, let's talk about the most classical method
of knowing your position without GPS

13
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:16,466
Have you ever heard of the speed unit called "knots"?

14
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:20,000
It's used for ship speeds, right?

15
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,966
This unit actually comes from a measurement method
invented by ancient sailors

16
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:29,933
They tied knots at regular intervals on a rope

17
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:32,233
And threw it into the sea

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,666
They counted how many knots passed
while the sand in an hourglass fell

19
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,166
This told them their speed

20
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,433
It's a really clever method, isn't it?

21
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:47,566
Distance traveled can be calculated by multiplying speed and time

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,366
It's a formula you learn in middle school
but this is the basis of inertial navigation

23
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:57,600
But in real movement, speed changes, right?

24
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,300
Accelerating and decelerating

25
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:08,266
In that case, you can plot speed versus time on a graph
and find the distance traveled from the area under the curve

26
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:11,800
This is what we call integration in mathematics

27
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:21,000
But modern aircraft and ships commonly measure acceleration
rather than velocity to determine position

28
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:26,033
Why measure acceleration instead of velocity?

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,766
When you're on an airplane
you feel takeoff and landing with your body, right?

30
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:40,200
But during stable flight, you can't even tell if you're moving
without looking out the window

31
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,866
In other words, it's difficult to directly measure velocity
inside a vehicle moving at constant speed

32
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:51,466
Measuring velocity requires an external reference

33
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:56,700
But acceleration can be measured without an external reference

34
00:02:57,266 --> 00:03:04,400
That's why inertial navigation measures acceleration
and integrates it twice to find position

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:12,200
It's a self-contained system that can work on its own
without external information

36
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,800
But there's a big problem here

37
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:24,233
If there's a slight error in the accelerometer
that error accumulates with each integration

38
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:34,833
Moreover, since distance is calculated by integrating
acceleration twice, the error grows proportionally to the square of time

39
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:45,266
Even with today's high-precision aircraft accelerometers
the error reaches about 6.5 km after 10 hours

40
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,533
This makes it unusable for long-distance navigation

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,200
That's why we currently use GPS corrections periodically
to reset the error

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,000
Aircraft, ships, smartphones - they all use this method

43
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:11,333
So current positioning technology requires
external information like GPS

44
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,966
But GPS has weaknesses too

45
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:21,900
Since it uses radio waves from satellites
naturally it can't work where signals can't reach

46
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,133
For example, underwater

47
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:29,900
GPS cannot measure the position of submarines or underwater drones

48
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:36,833
It also doesn't work in tunnels, underground spaces, or urban canyons

49
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,266
What's even scarier is malicious attacks

50
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:52,633
Spoofing sends fake GPS signals to cause position errors
and jamming disables GPS with interference signals

51
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,333
These are real threats in conflict zones and near borders

52
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,166
This is where quantum mechanics comes in

53
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,266
In 1924, a physicist named Louis de Broglie
proposed a remarkable theory

54
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:17,800
"All matter has wave-like properties"
This is called matter waves

55
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:22,533
The wavelength λ can be expressed by this formula

56
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:33,366
h is Planck's constant, m is mass, v is velocity
In other words, slower-moving objects have longer wavelengths

57
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:40,466
Just as light, which was thought to be a wave
also has particle-like properties

58
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:47,300
Atoms, which were thought to be particles
also have wave-like properties at the same time

59
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:50,900
Have you ever seen light interference patterns?

60
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,466
When light waves with matching wavelengths collide
they create bright and dark stripe patterns

61
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:04,900
Since atoms also have wave properties, they can do the same thing
but there's a problem as they are

62
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,666
Hot atoms move at random velocities

63
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,733
Random velocities mean random wavelengths

64
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
This causes the interference pattern to blur

65
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:19,200
That's why we cool the atoms

66
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:23,833
Cooling slows them down and narrows the velocity distribution

67
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:25,633
The wavelengths align

68
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:30,866
Only then can we create clean interference

69
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:36,100
But how do you cool atoms?

70
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,533
Do you put them in a freezer?

71
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,633
Actually, we use a literally cooler method

72
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:47,800
We cool them using lasers

73
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,400
When an atom absorbs a photon, it receives the photon's momentum and gets pushed

74
00:06:54,766 --> 00:07:00,633
If we shine a laser opposite to the atom's direction of travel, the atom slows down

75
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:07,833
We can also selectively slow only fast atoms using the Doppler effect

76
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:13,166
Approaching atoms see a higher frequency and resonate

77
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:18,933
Receding atoms see a lower frequency and don't resonate

78
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:28,466
With laser cooling, we can reach temperatures very close to absolute zero
-273.15 degrees Celsius

79
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:32,833
We can make it colder than outer space

80
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,266
So what do we do with these cooled atoms?

81
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:42,333
Now we move from cooling to a different laser operation

82
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:47,733
We make the cooled atoms interfere
to measure acceleration

83
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:54,300
There's a light-based interferometer
called the Mach-Zehnder interferometer

84
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,400
Light is split into two paths by a half-mirror

85
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:02,900
The light from each path is then recombined

86
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:07,133
When there's a path difference, interference patterns form

87
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,833
Atom interferometers work on the same principle

88
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:16,200
The key point is that laser pulses can manipulate atomic paths

89
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:25,400
Applying laser pulses corresponds to splitting light at a half-mirror
or reflecting off a mirror

90
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:35,066
When two lasers with slightly different frequencies hit an atom
the atom's internal state and momentum change simultaneously

91
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,400
This is called Raman transition

92
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,266
By controlling the atomic path with lasers

93
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,733
We can create interference due to path differences

94
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,566
Atom interferometers use three laser pulses

95
00:08:52,966 --> 00:09:02,800
The first laser pulse splits the atom
creating a superposition of ground state |g⟩ and excited state |e⟩

96
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,866
It serves the same role as a half-mirror in optical systems

97
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:12,366
The second laser pulse reverses the paths

98
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,200
It swaps the ground state |g⟩ and excited state |e⟩

99
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:21,333
This corresponds to mirror reflection in optical systems

100
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:27,233
The final laser pulse
superimposes the two paths to create interference

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,533
It serves as a half-mirror, just like the first pulse

102
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:39,966
In this way, three laser pulses can realize
a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with atoms

103
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:47,133
If there's acceleration
the two paths experience different force histories

104
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,666
This difference appears as a phase shift

105
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,200
The phase difference Δφ can be written as this formula

106
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:03,066
This phase difference can ultimately be observed
as the probability of being in ground state |g⟩

107
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:10,400
By using many atoms and measuring statistically
we can determine the acceleration

108
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,166
Comparing with conventional MEMS accelerometers
shows that atom interferometers have extremely high precision

109
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:29,433
The precision of atom interferometers is around
10⁻⁹ to 10⁻¹² m/s²

110
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:34,800
This means an error of only about 65 cm for a 10-hour flight

111
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:40,400
Long-duration high-precision positioning is possible without GPS

112
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:47,733
Atom interferometers are based on atomic transition frequencies
which are fundamental constants of nature

113
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,866
Planck's constant and the speed of light
are the same everywhere in the universe, at all times

114
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:57,166
That's why such precise measurements are possible

115
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:05,933
You might be thinking "It might work in theory
but can it really be put into practical use?"

116
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:10,533
Actually, demonstration tests have already succeeded

117
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:21,433
Boeing, the famous aircraft manufacturer
achieved a 4-hour GPS-free flight in 2025

118
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:31,000
Q-CTRL, an Australian startup company
achieved 22m precision with a Cessna aircraft

119
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:36,533
They won Time magazine's 2025 Best Inventions award

120
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,666
The British Navy has also succeeded in submarine tests

121
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:50,533
While still in the research stage
it's attracting worldwide attention as next-generation positioning technology

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,366
There are still many challenges like device miniaturization and cost reduction

123
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:07,433
But advances in semiconductor lasers and atom chip technology
used in quantum computers are bringing it closer to practical use each year

124
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,933
Quantum mechanics might seem like
a mysterious and strange world

125
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,933
But like quantum navigation
it's working as the foundation for technologies that benefit our daily lives

126
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,233
Just as smartphone GPS became commonplace

127
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:32,200
Quantum navigation might become commonplace someday too

128
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:37,233
Until next time, take care!
